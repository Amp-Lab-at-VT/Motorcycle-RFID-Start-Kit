## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

This project is a motorcycle push to start RFID system which will be placed in a motorcycle already owned. The push to start system will use RFID to verify that the owner is near the motorcycle, and then will allow a button be used to start the motorcycle. This system will be wired in place of the existing ignition module on the motorcycle.

## Educational Value Added

This project requires skills pertaining to microcontroller programming and PCB design. This project will also require skills in design by constraint as the project will have to interface where the existing ignition module already exists (constraints are the physical size and electrical wiring interface). This project allows students to learn about radio frequency transmitters and will teach fundementals in radio frequency tranmission via arduino rfid module.

## Tasks

Create a block diagram of the system.
Research the ignition wiring and determine how it works.
Source an arduino and rfid module and create an rfid demonstation.

## Design Decisions

PCB design, microcontroller on existing pcb (arduino) or stm32(or other) microcontroller on custom pcb?


## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

Will create joint project timeline.

## BOM + Component Cost

10$-50$ for ordering PCB and arduino rfid module. arduino already sourced.
